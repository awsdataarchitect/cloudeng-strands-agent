# AWS Cloud Engineer Agent - Update

## Important Update for Windows Users

The code has been updated to handle the issue with running `cloud_engineer_agent.py` directly on Windows. The following changes have been made:

1. Added robust error handling for MCP client initialization
2. Implemented a fallback mechanism when MCP tools are not available
3. Added clear user guidance and troubleshooting information
4. Updated the Streamlit app to work with or without MCP tools

## Running the Application

### Option 1: Using Streamlit (Recommended)

The recommended way to run the application is still using Streamlit:

```
streamlit run app.py
```

### Option 2: Running cloud_engineer_agent.py Directly

You can now run the cloud_engineer_agent.py script directly:

```
python cloud_engineer_agent.py
```

The script will:
- Check if the required "uvx" command is available
- Initialize available tools
- Provide clear status information
- Run with limited functionality if MCP tools are not available

## Installing Universal Command Line Interface (uvx)

For full functionality, including AWS Documentation and AWS Diagram tools, you need to install the Universal Command Line Interface (uvx):

1. Visit: https://strandsagents.com/0.1.x/getting-started/installation/
2. Follow the installation instructions for your platform
3. Restart your application after installation

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. Ensure you have valid AWS credentials configured
2. Check your internet connection
3. Verify that you have the required permissions in your AWS account
4. For Windows users, make sure Python is properly installed and in your PATH
5. Try running the application in a virtual environment

## Limitations

When running without MCP tools (if uvx is not installed):
- AWS Documentation search will not be available
- AWS Diagram generation will not be available
- Other AWS operations will continue to work normally
